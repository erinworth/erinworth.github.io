title: Life after Bloc
---
I think about what my future may look like when I complete the Bloc program often.  Ultimately, I believe most of us want a high paying job with great flexibility of schedule.  I understand that there is still so much to learn and I want to continue doing so in a comfortable position on a team when I can meet, learn and create with other developers.

The nice thing about being in Portland is that there is a very large community of Women in technology and the local chapter of [ChickTech] (https://chicktech.org/) is very active.  There are several social events hosted through out the year that help bring women together that are in what is one of the last male dominated industries.  I plan on using these events to branch out, meet people, learn about new technology, and hopefully learn to become a better coder.

Sometimes I envision being apart of a small group of designers and coders locally and starting our own company to design and build sites and apps.  I know my limitations when it comes to design, but my goal would be able to take something that a designer can create and layout and translate that to the vision of what the client desires.

I do have loftier long-term goals though.  As my husband begins to travel more with his job, I would like the flexibility of being able to work on the road with him.  Whether I contract out or I find remote employment, I would like to ultimately be able to work from any location.  This also gives me the flexibility in life to not feel tied down to a desk and a 9-5 job, which is one of the main reasons in turning to web design in the first place.  

I look forward to wherever this post Bloc life journey takes me...
