title: Baking and coding have quite a bit in common...
---

There are more similarities in coding and baking then most may think.  When you think about coding you think about the main aspects: algorithms, sorting loops, and conditional statements.  Baking requires the same aspects to have a complete finished product.

•	Algorithm:  This is your recipe.  If followed correctly you should have a complete finished product after all of the steps are complete.
•	Loops: Each repetitive is a loop.  Whether its adding eggs one at a time and stirring to scooping out cookie dough and placing it on a sheet pan, these loops will continue until you run out of eggs or dough and then the loop comes to an end.
•	Sorting:  We use loops to sort through all of the ingredients.   They could be sorted by type of ingredients (wet vs. dry), color, amount, or any other similar trait.  
•	Conditional Statements:  Conditional statements use If and Else (and sometimes Else-If).  These are also used when baking.  Conditional statements help figure out the status and complete the process of the loop.  If batter is not combined keep stirring until it all comes together.  If there is still dough in the bowl, keep scooping until the task is complete.  If the cookies are brown on top, remove from oven and let cool.

If anyone has taken the hint, most of my baking reference has been in regards to cookies.  I have attached a link to the [Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe](https://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/) since it is always my go to cookie recipe.

A few cookie hints.  If you like them softer and chewier (but may result in flatter cookies) add a little more butter and reduce the flour.  If you like them firmer (but may result in drier crispier cookies) do the opposite.  I think this recipe is perfect but I also live at sea level and don’t have to deal with elevation and humidity challenges.
