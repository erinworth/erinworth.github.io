I have always had a computer in my life.  I was very luck to have a pc back in 1985 that worked using the DOS terminal where you had to make it read the correct drive just to play Face Maker off of a floppy disk.  I feel like even back then I knew eventually my life would come back full circle to computers.  I was always the person who diagnosed the computer when it had hardware issues, but I knew very little of the coding that I would learn through Bloc.

My coding journey to and through Bloc has been a bit of an interesting one.  About two years ago I had signed up for an intro class through our local community college.  Before the third class, the school putting the classes on had completely shut down.  I continued to use an online program called [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) to see if this was something I wanted to pursue before signing up for another class.  I was enjoying the HTML, CSS and Java programs, but I knew if I wanted to pursue this professionally I would have to sign up for an academy where there was more structure and I had people around me to answer questions.

I was fortunate enough to have a friend of mine making a career change to coding as well.  After a few months of research Bloc seemed to make the most sense for us.  Lani started her Bloc track in October of 2016 whereas due to timing I wasn’t able to start the frontend foundations until January of 2017.  It has been great to have a friend that knows the program.  I have used her as one of my resources when trying to troubleshoot my problems.

I came to programing in Bloc after having taken some previous free courses, but I still feel like I wasn’t prepared for the vigorous program of Bloc.  It was hard to digest so much information being thrown at me.  It has taught me how to express in detail exactly how I want something to look, react, or function.  From there I am able to use all of my tools available to achieve it, whether it is through my Bloc mentor Zach, my coding friend Lani, or just searching the web for people that have solved the problems that I’m currently trying to solve.

I have my frustrating days in which I am working on a problem for 24 hours only to find out my glitch in my code is a measly semi-colon or uppercase letter and I think that I would be better staying in my same job.  I always remember that I’m on a journey that won’t be a piece of cake (otherwise everyone else would be in the same field) and if I stick to the program, ask relevant questions, and keep persevering, then I should be able to attain my short term and long term goals.  I just have to take it one code at a time.
