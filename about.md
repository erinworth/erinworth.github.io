I currently reside in Portland, OR with my husband and rescue dog Willow.  I have spent the last year and a half teaching myself to become a front-end developer with the programs through [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) and [Bloc](https://bloc.io).  Though I was given a well rounded education in the backend fundamentals of Ruby and Rails, I prefer to stick with Java, Javascript, and React.

Before coding I have spent a majority of my working career in the food and hospitality industry.  I'm a classically trained chef and have worked in the kitchens, managed front of the house operations, owned my own cafe and catering business, and done bookkeeping and human resources for a restaurant group.  I'm hoping to break out of this mold unless I end up doing development projects the industry in the future.  I still cook and bake but it's more on a personal basis for friends and family.

When I'm not working I prefer to spend time with my husband and dog exploring our neighborhood, going to the movies, hanging out with friends, wine tasting, traveling, and reading.  I am also an avid self-taught knitter and crocheter.  Youtube can teach you just about anything.  I like to make little gifts for friends and family.  I also find it a great excuse to catch up on tv without feeling guilty.

I look forward to what my future holds for me in the world web development.
