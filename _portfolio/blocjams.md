### Explanation

BlocJams is a browser based replica of Spotify.  It allows the user to select, view, and play any album of their choosing.  This was a great way to showcase my knowledge of front end fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and DOM.  When the project was completed we converted all of the vanilla Javascript into JQuery.
